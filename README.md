## Planetary Crater Detection System

This project implements a classical computer vision pipeline to detect planetary bodies,
identify surface craters, and compute crater surface coverage.

- Planet detection via Hough Circle Transform
- Crater detection using edge-based circular extraction
- Surface coverage computation
- FastAPI backend + Blazor WebAssembly frontend

# Technologies
- Python, OpenCV, NumPy
- FastAPI
- Blazor WebAssembly
